		* Good looking padding should come by default.
		* Identify some use cases for padding so the common needs are easy.  It's OK if the uncommon needs are not fullfilled.
		* When padding is specified on the window it might render more padding by default.
		* CSS padding refers to the inside of the box.  It would be good to follow this convention however the word padding doesn't imply inside or outside.

Approach:
		* every component will default to margin="auto".  Auto margins means
			left and top margins for every component and right and bottom margins for all
			components on the last row or column.
		* All containers (<layout auto-margins="false">, <row> and <col>) can specify a `pad` attribute which creates an inside border of padding.
